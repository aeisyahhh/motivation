<h1 style="color:hotpink;">My motivation towards online education:  <q>Get a better grade compared to previous semester</q></h1>

<p>1) Get to know the (online) system: 
Even I dont consider myself technologically inclined, maybe Ill be surprised how quick I can become accustomed to the online learning environment. Take time to get to know my online university s operating system before your classes begin. Ill find that the more familiar you are with your university s operating system, the more prepared Ill be to excel in your online classes.</p>

<p>2) Log in often: 
Exams. Quizzes. Papers. Discussions. Theres a lot going on in online classes. Thats why its important for me to log in often to keep up with what s going on in each online class. Active discussions, my classmates will be commenting on your posts, and Ill want to comment on theirs as well. If Im not logging in every day twice a day, at a minimum I may miss feedback from faculty, posted grades, announcements, and much more. Online vs traditional education means I have to check in more frequently, a small price to pay for the convenience of online education.</p>

<p>3) Take advantage of resources: 
Need help choosing online classes? Advisors are ready to assist me in selecting the right courses for my chosen program of study. Having trouble writing a research paper or with my financial assignment? Online universities offer assistance with writing, math, and much more, just as traditional, campus based institutions do. The only difference? I dont have to leave my chair to take advantage of them.</p>

<p>4) Be open: 
When it comes to online vs traditional education, an open mind is key. Online education isnt classroom based education and its not supposed to be. Embrace the differences, participate in discussions, ask questions, reach out to classmates and instructors, and let my personality shine. Ill soon discover that Ive signed up for more than online classes.</p>
